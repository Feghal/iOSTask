# iOS Task


## Requirements

- Create application with Swift.
- The Application should request and take information about `/photos`  from JsonPlaceholder[^1] and place in your local Database (application must work offline).
- We prefer you to use CoreData, but you are free to use any Database you want like Realm or other.
- Show the list in the table view, every cell must contain a title and an image.
- Use pagination to request and show first 20 items and then request from server and add new 20 items when user scrolls down to last cells.
- Write a clean, readable code.

## Optional

- Do not use any third part SDK.
- Comment and document your code, where it is required.

## Expectations
Document your coding process with Git and publish it on your public repository in Github. At the end we will clone your code and run it on our local machines. The result in the repository must contain git history of your development process (a single commit with the complete application is not acceptable. We want to see multiple commits showing your progress).

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us.
